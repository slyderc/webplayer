Plan to refactor everything to a new stack:

Flask + Alpine.js + Tailwind

Flask: Much more lightweight than Django, minimal by design
Alpine.js: Tiny JS framework (~8KB) that gives you reactive components without the React complexity
Tailwind: Still gives you styling benefits with minimal size when optimized

Published document with an overview of setting up this project:

Also the local filesystem in thie directory:
flask-alpine-tailwind-setup.md
